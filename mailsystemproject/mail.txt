You seriously need to stop claiming your paperclip orders under

I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
Hi Jemma,

Your cake was delicious.  I actually ate the whole thing last night.
What was your secret ingredient?  You promised you'd tell me after I
ate it.

Expense Report
Jason,

The expense report you filled out was missing a 356B attachment.
I'm sure you just forgot it.  Please bring it over to my office
when you can.

Dinner Thursday
Hi Jason,

I don't think we can make it to dinner on Thursday---Julia's knees
aren't what they used to be.  Maybe next week?

Dinner Next Week
Hi Bob,

Of course I knew that about Julia, I'm sorry that I didn't think about
that ahead of time.  How about next Wednesday you come over for
Mexican, and we'll skip the football?
